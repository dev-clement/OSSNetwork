= 🚀 Project Charter: OSS Network 🌐

== 1. Project Overview 📝

OSS Network is a specialized social platform designed to bridge the gap between open-source project maintainers and developers looking for meaningful contributions. 🤝 Unlike generic code hosting platforms, it focuses on the social and professional connection side of open source, helping developers build a "Contribution Portfolio" 🏆 and helping maintainers find reliable help. ✨

=== 💡 Project Origins & Credit

This project concept was originally sparked by a LinkedIn colleague and Prime Architect 🏗️ who has been working tirelessly on modernizing community collaboration. Her vision for a more connected, architecturally sound open-source ecosystem serves as the foundation for this implementation. This project aims to bring those high-level architectural goals into a functional reality. 👩‍💻🔥

== 2. Core Functional Requirements (User Stories) 👤

The application will be built around these primary pillars:

=== A. Authentication & Identity 🔐

* *Standard Auth:* Users can register, sign in, and sign out using email and password. 📧
* *GitHub Integration:* Future support for OAuth2 to link GitHub profiles to the OSS Network identity. 🐙
* *User Profiles:* Displays user bio, tech stack (e.g., Python, Vue), and a history of their OSS contributions. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

=== B. Project Discovery 🔍

* *OSS Directory:* A searchable list of registered projects. 📂
* *Project Dashboard:* A view for each project showing its repository link, description, and "Help Wanted" status. 💡
* *Submission:* Any registered user can suggest/index an existing OSS project on the platform. 📥

=== C. Contribution Management 🛠️

* *Request System:* A formal "Ask to Contribute" flow where a user expresses interest in a project. 🙋‍♂️
* *Status Tracking:* A pipeline to track the state of a contribution: Interested → In Progress → Merged/Completed. ✅

== 3. Technical Stack (The Blueprint) 🏗️

The project utilizes a modern, containerized architecture:

|===
|Tier |Technology |Role

|Frontend 🎨
|Vue.js 3 + Vite
|High-performance Single Page Application (SPA).

|Backend ⚙️
|Python 3.12 + Django-Ninja
|Type-safe, FastAPI-style REST API with Django's reliability.

|Database 🗄️
|PostgreSQL 16
|Relational storage for users, projects, and social links.

|Management 📦
|Pixi
|Modern dependency and environment management.

|Infrastructure 🐳
|Docker Compose
|Orchestration of frontend, backend, and DB services.

|Reverse Proxy 🚦
|Nginx
|Traffic routing for /api and / (frontend) paths.
|===

== 4. System Architecture & Data Model 🗺️

To be implemented in the first phase:

* *User Model:* Extends the standard Django user with a github_handle and bio. 👤
* *Project Model:* Stores title, description, repository_url, and tags (languages). 📁
* *Contribution Model:* A many-to-many relationship linking Users to Projects with a status field. 🔗

== 5. Development Roadmap 📅

=== Phase 1: Infrastructure (Saturday Kick-off) 🏁

* Initialize the repository with docker-compose.yaml and pixi.toml. 🛠️
* Verify Nginx routing to both the Backend (Django-Ninja) and Frontend (Vue/Vite). 📡
* Establish the PostgreSQL connection. 🔌

=== Phase 2: Backend Core 🧠

* Implement the three core models (User, Project, Contribution). 💾
* Build the Django-Ninja API endpoints for Project Listing and Authentication. 🛣️

=== Phase 3: Frontend Implementation 💻

* Build the Vue.js dashboard to consume the API. 🖼️
* Implement the Project Discovery UI and the Contribution "Request" button. 🖱️

== Repository Structure

This repository serves as the main hub for the OSSNetwork application. It is organized to bring together multiple components:

=== Components

* *frontend/* - Vue.js 3 + Vite frontend application (linked as git submodule)
* *backend/* - Python 3.12 + Django-Ninja backend API (linked as git submodule)
* *deployment/* - Contains deployment configurations, scripts, and documentation

=== Architecture

The application is split into separate repositories for better modularity and development workflow:

* Frontend repository will handle the user interface and client-side logic
* Backend repository will handle the server-side API and business logic
* This main repository acts as the integration point and contains deployment configurations

=== Getting Started

==== Clone the Repository with Submodules

To clone this repository along with all its submodules (frontend and backend):

[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dev-clement/OSSNetwork.git
----

==== Initialize Submodules in an Existing Clone

If you've already cloned the repository without submodules, you can initialize and fetch them:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

==== Update Submodules

To update the submodules to their latest commits:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --remote
----
