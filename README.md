# OSSNetwork
Application acting as a network for open-source projects and engineers that decide to work on them.

## Repository Structure

This repository serves as the main hub for the OSSNetwork application. It is organized to bring together multiple components:

- **backend/** - (To be added) Link to the back-end repository  
- **deployment/** - Contains deployment configurations, scripts, and documentation

### Architecture

The application is split into separate repositories for better modularity and development workflow:
- Frontend repository will handle the user interface and client-side logic
- Backend repository will handle the server-side API and business logic
- This main repository acts as the integration point and contains deployment configurations
